## Introduction

Imagine you are writing a paper.
You have learned a lot about reproducibility (even perhaps in this book), you like the idea, and you want to apply the standards that make your research more reproducible.
You have a project structure according to your community standard, you use human and machine-readable names, you provide a lot of metadata, you track your analyses with Git, and you even set up a robust, reproducible environment for all the R packages you need for your analyses.
You now want to start writing your paper, open e.g. MS Word, and start writing.
At some point you write the *Results* section.
Now you want to insert your results in your Word-Document.
Some frustrating work begins, where you start to type the results of your analyses in Word.
Further, you inserted the figures that visualize your findings.
It took a while, but finally everything is included in that Word document -- congratulations.

Happily you ask some colleagues and your supervisor to review the paper.
They make some comments about your theoretical background and also about - oh gosh -  your results.
You did forget to filter some cases in the beginning and now you have to rerun the analysis.
No problem, you smoothly got the updated results, but then you realize that you have to insert the slightly different figures and results into your Word Document.
All this effort of typing the results from your R code to Word has to be done again.
This can happen many times during your research process.
Not only by colleagues and supervisors, but also when you found out an error by yourself.
Another possibility are reviewers, when you submitted a preprint to a journal.
During this process, it is very likely that you mix up some results, e.g. writing the *p* value of your first hypothesis to your second hypothesis.
Thus, transferring results from your statistic program to a text program is an opportunity for reproducibility errors.
Not because you are dumb, it is because you are human.
However, there is a solution to this problem - and it is called **Literate Programming**.

## What is literate programming?

Literate programming is a form of programming in which text and source code are in **one document**.
It is based on the idea that a code should be easy and enjoyable to read and aimed at being understood by humans, which was called *Literate Programming* by @knuth84.
Instead of writing code and later annotating it with comments, literate programming suggests to write a text in the order that a person would logically conceive it and include the code as it is explained in the text.
Thus, in literate programming, text is used to make code understandable.
<!--A well-known example are Jupyter Notebooks where normal text is interwoven with code-chunks that are executable within the text.
# I think that not many people can refer to Jupyter Notebooks (at least in the seminar)-->
However, the concept of literate programming was extended to the idea that the text should not support the explanation for the code but rather the code can be an explanation of the document.
Thus, one can write a whole paper and uses code directly in that document to support the claims made in that document.
The code in these documents are stored in **chunks** (see later section) and are executable.

Literate programming allows for creating **reproducible documents** instead of just reproducible script as well as making for a smoother workflow, as there is no need for switching out old and new outputs in your documents when the code changed.
As an example, when you write an article in a document using literate programming and insert a code chunk that creates a plot, this code chunk's output (i.e. the plot) is part of your document and is always up to date with the script you're running.
Hence, whenever you have to do some changes in your plot or your analyses, the changes are directly updated in your paper.
Thus, the paper becomes [dynamic](@nte-dynamic-documents).
Moreover, literate programming can heavily reduce outcome-based reproducibility errors (@sec-repro-errors).

::: {#nte-dynamic-documents .callout-note title="Static vs. Dynamic documents" collapse="true"}
One can discriminate static and dynamic documents.
Most documents are static, since they do not refer to underlying data or content.
They are typically generated once and do rarely need updates.

On the other hand, dynamic documents are generated anew if some underlying data or content changes.
They are often automatically recreated and use some kind of code to generate up-to-date content.
Since research paper are often reviewed and many changes must be done, one can view paper as dynamic documents.

**Examples**

|Static documents|Dynamic documents|
|:--------------|:------------------|
|working agreement|research paper|
|bills|dashboards|

<!-- I am not happy about this discrimination. I have to look over it again-->

## What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source **Publishing System**.
It allows you to do literate programming.
It was created by the company [Posit](https://posit.co), which is responsible for RStudio and is based on RMarkdown.
Quarto is well integrated in RStudio and comes already bundled with any version of RStudio from RStudio v2022.07.1 "Spotted Wakerobin" onward (<https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/documents/quarto-project.html#installing-quarto>).
What Quarto does is, it can interpret and handle many programming languages (e.g. R and Python) as well as plain text and transforms it into standard output formats (e.g., Word-, PDF-, and .html-files, see @fig-quarto-idea).

![This illustration shows schematically that one can have input in different languages and Quarto will produce different output formats. Artwork from "Hello, Quarto" keynote by Julia Lowndes and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, presented at RStudio Conference 2022. Illustrated by Allison Horst. Used under a [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) license.](../static/horst-quarto-schematic.jpg){#fig-quarto-idea}

With Quarto, one is able to create (scientific) papers, but also websites, presentations or books.
In fact, this book is written with Quarto.
To do so, Quarto has its own file extension (`.qmd`). `qmd` stands for **Q**uarto **M**ark**d**own.
We will get to the Markdown language in a second (@sec-markdown).
Everything you write in a Quarto file will then be **rendered** into a desired output file (e.g. .html, .pdf, .docx).
As example, @fig-quarto-example-document-plot shows a Quarto document that contains human-readable text and a code chunk that will create a plot, as well as it's rendered version below.

![On the left is a Quarto document in RStudio, containing a code chunk that creates a simple plot. On the right is the rendered version of the document, showing the text and the plot.

## How to use Quarto

In this book, we will focus on using Quarto in RStudio, but Quarto can also be used with other editors such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).
To start using Quarto, you must create a Quarto document.
To do so, head to RStudio and in the upper left corner select **File \> New File \> Quarto Document...**.
This will open a box (see @fig-quarto-box-create-document) that prompts you to give your document a title, which will appear at the top of your document's rendered version, as well as choosing the format that your output will be in.
Either HTML, PDF or Word are possible by default.
The standard output is HTML and you do not need to have anything else installed to create html documents.
If you want to create PDF or Word Documents by Quarto, you need additional software. 
For PDF-files, LaTeX[^1] is required and for Word-files, MS Word is required.

[^1]: LaTeX is another markup language, such as markdown.
To create PDF files from Quarto documents, you do not need to learn the markup language, but you need a LaTeX installation.
To do so, follow the link displayed in @fig-quarto-box-create-document (<https://yihui.org/tinytex>).

HTML files can also easily be turned into PDF files later on and the format is changeable. 
Depending on your project, there are other available format options as well.
The metadata of title and format is stored in the so called **YAML header** at the top of your page.
This is also where you can further customize some general features of your file, such as the author, a subtitle, the date or the style of your document (see @sec-yaml-header).
To create the Quarto document, choose your preferred output format, type in at least the title of the document, and click on **Create** in the prompt box.

![Prompt box that opens when intending to create a new Quarto document. Used under a [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) license.](../static/quarto-box-create-document.png){#fig-quarto-box-create-document fig-align="center" width="70%" height="70%"}

<!--Insert pullout box about what info can be put into the YAML -->

To get a preview of a Quarto file in RStudio, you can either use `quarto preview` in the command line or the **Render** button at the top of your document.
This will show you how your rendered document will look like and if you check the **Render on Save** box at the top of the document, will update live as you save your changes.
For an example, see @fig-quarto-example-document-plot.

## Markdown {#sec-markdown}

In Quarto documents, **Markdown** is used as a syntax.
In Markdown content and formatting are integrated with each other and not separate.
This formatting is used in Quarto or on GitHub or on a smaller scale in WhatsApp or Reddit.  
There are some advantage over more commonly known way of formatting in e.g., MS Word.
Using an integrated approach to formatting and writing allows for faster writing, as there is no need to switch between the two.
You just format as you type.
Another advantage is compatibility between different text editors.
Any program that uses Markdown will format a document written in it the exact same way. 
Another advantage is that Git can track the changes made to text written with Markdown, allowing for version control of your written work the same way as of your code.  
Disadvantages are that there are overall less formatting options as the intention is keep it simple and it can be difficult or unintuitive to insert tables and images.  

Formatting can be done using either the `Source` or `Visual` mode in RStudio.
In the `Source` mode you use Markdown syntax to format your written work and in the `Visual` mode you use a User-Interface similar to how you would use in e.g., MS Word.
Switch between the two at any time.
The changes made in the `Visual` mode will appear in the `Source` mode in Markdown as well.
Take a look at the two different modes and the rendered version of the document below with some simple formatting options.

![On the left is the Source mode of the .qmd file and on the right the Visual formatting mode. Used under a [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) license.](../static/quarto-visual-source-mode.jpg)

Now, take a look at the rendered version of the document and how each of the formatting options plays out.

## Features

There are some nice features that can be implemented in Quarto, such as including code chunks, as mentioned before with the example of a plot, inline code as well as referencing and citations.

### Code chunks

-   **Executable code:** Quarto files support code execution during rendering
-   Code chunks can be interactive
-   **Customizable options:** Specify various options for code chunks
-   You can also use *inline code*
-   R code enclosed by: ```` ```{r} code ``` ````

#### Examples
##### Input
```{r}
#| output: FALSE
#| label: code-example
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 1, 3, 5)
plot(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot Example", xlab = "X-Axis", ylab = "Y-Axis")
```

##### Output

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| echo: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 1, 3, 5)
plot(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot Example", xlab = "X-Axis", ylab = "Y-Axis")
```

### Inline code

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
#### Input

```{markdown filename="Code"}
Number of observations: `r 8*20`
```
:::
::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
#### Output

Number of observations: `r 8*20`
:::
::::
:::::

::: {.notes}
Code: you don't have to use it for a new entry book but its possible
:::

### Referencing

-   You can name and references objects like figures, tables etc.
-   For example: @sec-citations (`@sec-citations`)

| Type         | Label Prefix |
|--------------|--------------|
| Figures      | fig-         |
| Tables       | tbl-         |
| Equations    | eq-          |
| Sections     | sec-         |
| Code listing | lst-         |
| Theorem      | thm-         |

### Citations {#sec-citations}

-   Citations can be added via **Insert** > **Citation**
-   Citations can also be added directly with `@`
-   References are stored in [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.org/) files in your project

## Quarto extensions

One nice feature of Quarto are it's [extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/).
These extensions are created from Quarto users to extend the behavior and functionality of quarto.
Since Quarto contributes to the movement of Open Science and Reproducibility, these extensions are freely available.

### The `apaquarto` extension {.unnumbered}

In this book, we will only deal with one extension - the `apaquarto` extension by William Joel Schneider.
With this extension, we can shape the output of our rendered quarto file into the format of the [APA guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/)[^2] without much effort.

[^2]: Many journals and universities require submissions to be in the APA format.
Thus, we think it is useful for many students and researchers to know about this extension.

### Install apaquarto

To install `apaquarto`, there are some prerequisites that you most likely already fulfil.

1. Install Quarto

1. Install a programming language (e.g {{< fa brands r-project >}})

1. Install a programming environment (e.g. RStudio)

After you have installed all things things, you can successfully install `apaquarto`.
Most likely you have installed R and RStudio.
To check whether Quarto is already installed, see @tip-quarto-check.

::: {#tip-quarto-check .callout-tip title="How to check whether Quarto is already installed" collapse="true"}
To check whether Quarto is already installed, open the Terminal at RStudio.
It should be right next to the Console.
If there is no Terminal, go to **Tools** > **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.
Then, the Terminal pane will open.
Write the following code into the Terminal:

```{zsh filename="Terminal"}
quarto --version
```

If you already have Quarto installed, the current version of Quarto should be displayed.

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false

1.4.551
```

If you have not installed Quarto yet, you might get a message like this:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false

Command "quarto --version" not found.
```

To install quarto, go head and follow the installation instructions at [this website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
:::

To install apaquarto, the installation guide offers multiple scenarios (see @tip-apaquarto-installation-guide).
According to the guide, it is possible to install the extension from the Terminal and from the Console.
However, in our experience, the console sometimes lead to errors, which is why we recommend to use the Terminal.

Steps to install the apaquarto extension:

1. Open your project folder in RStudio.
In the folder you should write the Quarto document.

1. Go to the terminal in RStudio

1. Type the following command in the command line of the Terminal:

```{zsh filename="Terminal"}
quarto add wjschne/apaquarto
```

4. You will get an output like this:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
Quarto extensions may execute code when documents are rendered.
If you do not trust the author of the extension,
we recommend that you do not install or use the extension.
? Do you trust the authors of this extention (Y/n) >
```

5. Type in **Y** and hit **Enter**.
Then you will get another output like this:

```{zsh filename="Output"}

[✔] Downloading
[✔] Unzipping
          Found 1 extensions.
          
The following changes will be made:
My Document in APA Style, Seventh Edition    [No change]    (formats)
? Would you like to continue (Y/n) >
```

6. Again, type in **Y** and hit **Enter**.
Your output should be like this:

```{zsh filename="Output"}

[✔] Copying
[✔] Extension installation complete

? View documentation using default browser? (Y/n) >
```

7. No the installation is finished.
The Terminal asks you if you want to view the documentation online.
It is the same we are referring to in @tip-apaquarto-installation-guide.
No matter what you choose, you did successfully install the `apaquarto` extension.

When you now look at your project directory, you can see that a new folder exists called `_extensions`.
In that folder, there is a subfolder called `wjschne`, which, in turn, contains a subfolder `apaquarto`. In that `apaquarto` subfolder, there are many files that constitute the settings for the `apaquarto` extension.
We recommend not to change anything in this `_extensions` folder and all its subfolders manually.

### Implementing apaquarto in a quarto document

You now have the apaquarto extension installed, but when you render your Quarto document, it does not look like a document in APA style.
A last (and simple) step is to change the YAML header of your Quarto document.
You need to specify the `format` to be in apaquarto style.
To do so write the code below into your YAML header, save the changes, and re-render your Quarto document.

```{zsh filename="YAML header"}
format:
  apaquarto-docx: default # <1>
```

1. This code renders your Quarto document to an APA styled Word Document.
You can use `apaquarto-html` or `apaquarto-pdf` to render your `.qmd` file to a html or PDF file, respectively.

Now, your rendered Quarto document should be in APA style.
However, R would not be R and Quarto would not be Quarto if there is a small detail to consider.
This only works, when the *Quarto document* is placed in the *same folder as the* `_extensions` *folder*.

:::{.callout-caution title="Correct storage of your quarto file"}

Make sure that your Quarto document (`.qmd`) is stored in the same folder as your `_extensions` folder!

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Correct placement

Project Structure

```
.
| my-project.Rproj
| .gitignore
| README.html
| README.md
| apa-styled-quarto-document.qmd
| apa-styled-quarto-document.docx
| _extensions
  |-- wjschne
    |-- apaquarto
| code
| data
| renv
```

Above is displayed an excerpt of a project structure where the apaquarto extension works correctly.
The `.qmd`-file is at the same folder as the `_extensions` folder.

## Incorrect placement

Project Structure

```
.
| my-project.Rproj
| .gitignore
| README.html
| README.md
| apa-styled-quarto-document.qmd
| _extensions
  |-- wjschne
    |-- apaquarto
| code
| data
| report
  |--apa-styled-quarto-document.qmd
| renv
```

Above is displayed an excerpt of a project structure where the apaquarto extension does not work correctly.
The `.qmd`-file is not at the same folder as the `_extensions` folder.
Rather the `.qmd` file is located in the `reports` folder.
Thus, the `.qmd` file is located on layer below the `_extensions` folder.
Consequently, the apaquarto extension crushes when rerendering the Quarto document (which is why there is no .docx file in this project structure compared to the one that works correctly).

### Deleting apaquarto

In case you are not completely flashed by these features of `apaquarto` (or you just do not have to submit your work in APA style), you might not need the apaquarto extension in your project and want to remove it.
Despite dropping some tears, just type in the command below into your Terminal.

```{zsh filename="Terminal"}
quarto remove wjschne/apaquarto
```

You will get an output like this:

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false

? Are you sure you'd like to remove My Document in APA Style, Seventh Edition? (Y/n) >
```

Type in **Y** and hit **Enter**.
If you see the message below, you successfully deleted the extension form your project.

```{zsh filename="Output"}
#| code-copy: false

Extension removed.

```
