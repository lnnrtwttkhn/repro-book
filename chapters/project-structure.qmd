<h5>Learning objectives</h5>

:bulb: Be exposed to a couple of different project structure <br> 
:bulb: Get in touch with main components of project structure <br> 
:bulb: Think about advantages and disadvantages of particular project structures <br> 
:bulb: Sense the hurdles and visions of a decent project structure <br> 
:bulb: Take perspective on research as sequential vs. circular process

A good folder structure saves future you and other researchers a lot of time when trying to understand your data. 
Unfortunately, a *best practice standard* does not for a project structure yet. 
Below you can find numerous examples of different project structures:

## Exercise: Take on different perspectives

Pause for a moment after investigating the different project structures. 
Take the perspective of a researcher that is currently working in this project structure. 
How would you feel working with this structure? What helps you, hinders you to work productively and reproducible? 
Then change your perspective. 
Imagine you are a researcher aiming to reproduce the results of a different research project that uses such project structures. 
What would you need to reproduce analysis and results?
