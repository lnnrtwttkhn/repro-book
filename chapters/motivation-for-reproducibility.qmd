# Motivation for reproducible science

Reproducibility is a big topic, we spent a lot of work and time in writing a book about it and you will probably spend a lot time learning about it.
If you are asking the question "What for? Why should I do reproducible research?", that's completely reasonable.
We decided to dedicate a whole chapter to this question, because it is very important to us describing different facets of the topic reproducibility. 
Most of the arguments we will point out is not restricted to reproducibility but covers the whole topic of open science.

## Reproducibility: Simple and unneccesary?

After the definition of reproducibility in the previous chapter, you might have one of two thoughts:
Either you think, that getting the same results from the same data and code has to be common practice and super simple. 
Just to ruin your day, you can search for a paper with public code and data and try to reproduce the results from the article.
While you are doing this (or wisely not) you may also start to figure out that many problems can occur when trying to reproduce scientific results.
The amount of time spending on making your research reproducible and eventually prepare solutions for many different problems that can occur, can give you a headache.
Or you think that your time spending on making your research reproducible is simply not worth it. 
When you want to succeed as a researcher (PhD, Post-doc) and get a professorship at a university you need to get published in journals with high impact factors, significant results to get published in such journals and receive a lot of citations from other researchers. 
Where is the time for reproducibility?
Isn't the reward system of science directly against good research practices?
If you do not publish your code you can (un)intentionally and undetectedly make use of so-called questionable research practices.
You can selectively report outcomes that confirm your hypotheses and climb the career ladder.
Making your research reproducible and spend time with this learning resource is not valuable for your research career.

But there is also a different narrative:

## Reproducibility: Hard and worth-it
