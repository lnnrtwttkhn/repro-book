# Introduction

## What is reproducibility?

A good definition of reproducibility is given by The Turing Way Company:

Reproducibility

:   "At *The Turing Way* , we define **reproducible research** as work that can be independently recreated from the same data and the same code that the original team used. Reproducible is distinct from replicable, robust and generalisable as described in the figure below."

We will use this conceptualization of reproducibility throughout the book. Note, that reproducibility and *replicability* are two different terms. Replicability is achieved when the same analysis produce similar answers among *different* datasets, whereas reproducibility when the same analysis produce the same answer in the *same* dataset. That makes reproducibility the lowest common denominator in research.

## What this book is not about

Open Science is a huge movement with many aspects, that we cannot cover completely in this book. Reproducibility is one important aspect for striving to open science, but many topics are still left.

### Qustionable Research Practices (QRPs)

Questionable research practices (QRPs) have gained increasing attention since a popular article by John et al. (2012). We acknowledge the variety of QRPs and the need to face the issues raised by John et al. (2012), but that topic can fill another full book. If you feel engaged to learn more about QRPs, we recommend the [article](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611430953) by John et al. (2012), and other links <!--# Links will be inserted soon -->.

### Pre-registration

Pre-registrations have become popular as one answer to QRPs. However, even pre-registered studies can be irreproducible when data and code is not findable, accessible or understandable. In turn, a full reproducible research project does not necessarily have to be pre-registered. Both contribute in its own way to open science. If you want to find to pre-register your study, we recommend <https://aspredicted.org> or <https://osf.io>. If you want to learn more about pre-registration, we recommend the [website](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg) of the Center for Open Science.

### Statistics

Many aspects of this book will deal with [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), which are powerful tools for statistical programming. However, this book requires almost no statistical knowledge. You might find some t-tests or something similar in code-examples (see Section tidy data). The purpose of the book is not to increase your statistical knowledge and skills; the purpose of the book is to make your research more reproducible. If you want to learn more about statistics, we recommend [this free E-book](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf) by Danielle Navarro. If you prefer an analogous book, we recommend [Discovering statistics using R](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/discovering-statistics-using-r/book236067) by Andy Field.
